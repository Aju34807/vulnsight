# vulnsight
VulnSight is a Python-based network vulnerability scanner with both CLI and GUI interfaces. It uses Nmap to detect open ports and running services, then fetches known CVEs based on service versions. The tool highlights vulnerabilities with CVSS scores, supports modern UI elements, and generates detailed scan reports for analysis.
